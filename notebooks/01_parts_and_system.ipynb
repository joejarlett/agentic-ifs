    "# Internal Family Systems as Computational Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "**Internal Family Systems (IFS)**, developed by Richard Schwartz, models the mind as a system of discrete sub-personalities called *Parts*, governed by a core, undamaged essence called *Self*. Each Part carries a positive protective intent -- even when its behaviours are destructive. Parts organise into three roles: Managers (proactive protectors), Firefighters (reactive protectors), and Exiles (burdened vulnerabilities hidden by the other two).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `agentic-ifs` library formalises this model as a **multi-agent computational architecture**. Unlike standard multi-agent frameworks that optimise for external task completion, this library optimises for **internal system homeostasis**. Parts are not tools calling APIs -- they are agents with protective intentions, emotional charges, and relationships to each other and to Self.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces the core data structures: Parts, Burdens, and the SelfSystem. We will create instances of each Part type, inspect their fields, and explore how Self-energy works.\n",
