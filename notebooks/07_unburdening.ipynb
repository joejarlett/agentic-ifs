    "# Unburdening — The Healing Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "The 6 Fs (notebooks 01–05) are **Protector work** — finding, focusing on, and building trust with the Parts that guard the system. But the Protectors are not the source of the pain. They exist to protect **Exiles** — young, vulnerable Parts carrying unprocessed trauma (\"Burdens\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Once Protectors step back, the real healing begins: **Unburdening**. This is the five-stage pipeline that releases the Burden from an Exile and transforms it from a carrier of pain into a free Part.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Witnessing** — Self sits with the Exile and witnesses its story\n",
    "2. **Retrieval** — Self brings the Exile out of the trauma scene into present safety\n",
    "3. **Reparenting** — Self gives the Exile what it needed but never received\n",
    "4. **Purging** — The Exile releases the Burden via an element (fire, water, wind, earth, light)\n",
    "5. **Invitation** — The Exile takes on new qualities to fill the space left by the Burden\n",
    "\n",
    "Each stage gates on **Self-energy** — the same compassion threshold that operates in the 6 Fs. If a Protector blends during unburdening (which is common — Protectors often panic when Exile material surfaces), the pipeline pauses.\n",
