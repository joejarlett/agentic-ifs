# agentic-ifs

**Internal Family Systems as multi-agent computational architecture.**

`agentic-ifs` is a Python library that formalises the [Internal Family Systems (IFS)](https://ifs-institute.com) therapeutic model as a software architecture.

IFS treats the mind as a system of discrete sub-personalities ("Parts") governed by a core, undamaged essence ("Self"). This library provides rigorous data structures, state machines, and simulation primitives for researchers and builders working at the psychology/AI intersection.

## The Central Insight

Unlike standard multi-agent frameworks, `agentic-ifs` optimises for **internal system homeostasis**, not external task completion.

Parts are not tools calling APIs. They are agents with protective intentions, emotional charges, and relationships to each other and to Self.

**Self is not an agent.** Self is the system's operating environment — a global attractor state.

## Status

Pre-alpha. Spec in progress. Not ready for use.

See `spec/IFSKit-Spec.md` for the full architectural specification.

## Not Clinical Software

This library is for research, simulation, and philosophical exploration. It is not intended for clinical use, therapy delivery, or crisis support.

## Author

[Joe Jarlett](https://joejarlett.co.uk) — Bristol-based AI engineer and MSc psychologist. Trained in IFS, ACT, and Psychosynthesis.

## Theoretical Predecessor

[Kaj Sotala](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/kaj_sotala) mapped IFS to multi-agent reinforcement learning and AI alignment theory (Shard Theory). `agentic-ifs` is the software implementation of that theoretical work.
